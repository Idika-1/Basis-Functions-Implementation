# Basis-Functions-Implementation
This project demonstrates how to build several basis functions from scratch, leveraging JAX.

In this project, I successfully implemented the following:

Defined a Polynomial Basis Function to Handle Non-Linearity.
Defined a Gassian Basis Function for Flexibility
Defined a Fourier Basis Function for Periodicity
Optimized the Weights of each of the Three Basis Functions using both Gradient Descent and the Normal Equation
